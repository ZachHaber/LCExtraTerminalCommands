A continuation of https://github.com/Beauver/ExtraTerminalCommands.

This mod adds all kinds of commands to the terminal, each of these commands can be disabled in the config file.
- The new commands Ping/Flash and TP [Player] will be added to config/syncing in the next version.

If you encounter any bugs you can report them on the project github: 

# Commands
## Extra Commands
Shows the list of all commands that are enabled.

Aliases: Extra
## Random planet
This will send you to a random planet, you can specify these filters (Weather), more might be added in the future.

Aliases: Random, Random Weather
## Launch Ship
Pulls the launch lever to land or launch the ship.

Aliases: Launch, Start
## Teleporter
Activates the teleporter, respects teleporting cooldown. Include a player name to teleport a particular player.

Note: due to how the game works, TP [Player] switches the radar target to that player, then teleports them, then switches back.
This involves specific timeout delays that may or may not be enough depending on connection times.

Aliases: TP, TP [player]
## Inverse Teleporter
Activates the inverse teleporter, respects teleporting cooldown.

Aliases: ITP
## Flash Radar Booster
Flashes whatever radar booster is currently active on the radar, so you don't have to specify a name.

## Horn [Time (in seconds)]
Sounds the horn for the specified amount of time, if ran without a time it will default to config default.
This can be a fractional time (e.g. 1.5).

Plays the intro song (great great asset to the company ðŸ’ƒ), it plays for everyone.

Aliases: Intro
## Time

Due to weird behavior, `S` doesn't allow for switching to specific players with how I have it set up.
